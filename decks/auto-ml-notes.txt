// Competitions for AutoML solutions //

https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19836

This competition is different from classical Kaggle competition, you must send your code in a docker container, and then the code runs on a server, trains model on closed datasets and tests it. It's similar to ACM ICPC competitions because you send code instead of a CSV file.
The competition dataset is closed and developers cant see it. The model evaluates on real banks data.
The program receives at the entrance input train or test dataset name, task type (binary classification or regression) and calculation time limit. A program must train ML-model for a given time on a train set, and then make a prediction for a test set for the same time.
I think that machine learning competitions must transform from Kaggle-like competitions to docker-like.
